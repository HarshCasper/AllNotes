## Project Abstract üôã

This Web Application powered by MERN Stack will be making use of intuitive User-Interface and User-Experience to allow Students to come onto a One-Stop Portal and share Resources and Notes related to their Syllabus and Subjects which can benefit the Society as a whole. An integrated PDF-Viewer would allow the other students to check out the Resources and upvote a User depending on the usefulness of the Resources shared from his part. This Social Application would allow Students to connect over their love of Subjects and helping out of the Community in an effective way, benefitting a lot of Students in the longer run.

## Project Backgroundüí°

In Majority of the Colleges and Universities across India, Notes Sharing is done in Private WhatsApp Groups and Telegram Channels which often lead to other students missing out on important notes during Exam-Times. A One-Stop Solution can be to bring up an Application where Students can drop down their Notes for Public View, that can be accessed by anyone. 

To make it a gamified experience, other Users can upvote the contributions done by the Contributors which can be ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù in terms of Credits and more. We will also be working on adding more features to the Project, like specifying the nature of Notes and to whom it benefits the most which would allow the other User to filter and view specific content.
